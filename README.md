# Python-SharePoint-Authentication
A Python based script to authenticate a sharepoint connection. Increasingly finding the need to download data, extracted from Qlik into SharePoint, so that I can run python scripts on it.


## Background
I (Antony Thornton) was looking to export a Pivot table from Qlik to SharePoint but Qlik has no functionality to automate this currently. Its possible to export to SharePoint as a regular table and then use Python to turn that into a Pivot Table. 
However, in the process of doing that I was struggling with authenticating my SharePoint connection. It would hang and eventually fail. The purpose of this repository is to create a script that can be called to other projects to authenticate.

Call booked tomorrow with App Sup to talk through authenticating.
